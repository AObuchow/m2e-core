# Contributing to Eclipse m2eclipse

Thanks for your interest in this project.

## Project description

The goal of the Eclipse m2e project is to provide a first-class Apache Maven
support in the Eclipse IDE, making it easier to edit Maven's pom.xml, run a
build from the IDE and much more. For Java developers, the very tight
integration with JDT greatly simplifies the consumption of Java artifacts either
being hosted on open source repositories such as Maven Central, or in your
in-house Maven repository.
