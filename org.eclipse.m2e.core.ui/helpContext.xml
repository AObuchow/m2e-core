      <description>M2Eclipse requires metadata to map Maven execution goals to actions within Eclipse.  The m2e marketplace contains Eclipse plugins to provide this metadata for common Maven plugins.  

As safe defaults cannot be provided for every execution goal, custom lifecycle mapping metadata can be embedded into the pom or the goal can be ignored using a quickfix (it is up to the developer to determine which is the correct behaviour for their project.)</description>
